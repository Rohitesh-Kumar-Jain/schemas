Global Wordnet Formats
======================

![Global WordNet Association](https://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas/img/GWA_logo.png)

The Global WordNet Association provides three formats for which WordNets can be
published and submitted to the ILI. These are as follows:

* [Lexical Markup Framework compatible XML](#xml)
    * [Example](http://github.com/globalwordnet/schemas/blob/master/example.xml)
    * [DTD](http://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas/WN-LMF-1.0.dtd)
* [JSON-LD using the lemon Vocabulary](#json)
    * [Example](http://github.com/globalwordnet/schemas/blob/master/example.json)
    * [JSON-LD Context](http://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas/wn-json-context-1.0.json)
    * [Schema](http://github.com/globalwordnet/schemas/blob/master/wn-json-schema.json)
* [lemon-based RDF](#rdf)
    * [Example](http://github.com/globalwordnet/schemas/blob/master/example.ttl)

All of these formats are considered equivalent and a converter between them can 
be used at.

A converter and validator is available at [http://server1.nlp.insight-centre.org/gwn-converter/](http://server1.nlp.insight-centre.org/gwn-converter/)

XML
---

The XML is specified by the following [DTD](WN-LMF-1.0.dtd). An example is 
given [here](https://github.com/globalwordnet/schemas/blob/master/example.xml):

The first three lines must always be as follows:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE LexicalResource SYSTEM "http://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas/WN-LMF-1.0.dtd">
    <LexicalResource xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
    
A file may contain multiple WordNets in different languages:

The following information is required:

* id: A short name for the resource
* label: The full name for the resources
* language: Please follow BCP-47, i.e., use a two-letter code if 
             available else a three-letter code
* email: Please give a contact email address
* license: The license of your resource (please provide URL)
* version: A string identifying this version (preferably follow 
            major.minor format)
* url: A URL for your project homepage
* citation: The paper to cite for this resource

Extra properties may be included from Dublin core and in addition

* status: The status of the resource, e.g., "valid", "checked", "unchecked"
* confidenceScore: A numeric value between 0 and 1 giving the 
                    confidence in the correctness of the element.

Each word (lexical entry) must have a unique id:

            <LexicalEntry id="w1">

The part of speech values are as follows:

* n: Noun
* v: Verb
* a: Adjective
* r: Adverb
* s: Adjective Satellite
* c: Conjunction
* p: Adposition (Preposition, postposition, etc.)

* also: See also, a reference of weak meaning
* verb_group: Verb senses that similar in meaning and have been manually grouped together.
* participle: An adjective that is a participle form a verb

* derivation: A word that is derived from some other word
* domain_category: Indicates the category of this word
* domain_member_category: Indicates a word involved in this category described by this word

            </LexicalEntry>

If a synset is already mapped to the ILI please give the ID here. __All synsets must
have an ID that starts with ID of the lexicon followed by a dash, e.g., `example-en` + `-` + `local_synset_id`__.

            <Synset id="example-en-10161911-n" ili="i90287" partOfSpeech="n">

                <SynsetRelation relType="hypernym" target="example-en-10162692-n"/>

You may also indicate the words and the order in the synset. This should match 
the lexical entries

                <Member>grandfather</Member>
                <Member>paternal grandfather</Member>
            </Synset>

If you wish to define a new concept call the concept "in" (ILI New). If there is
no mapping to the ILI leave this field empty (it is required).

JSON
----

The JSON format follows that of the XML and is based on [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org)
[An example](https://github.com/globalwordnet/schemas/blob/master/example.json)
of the JSON is as follows:

The top level of a JSON graph consists of an object with two properties `@context`
which must be the fixed string referring to the JSON-LD context and `@graph`
giving the lexicon format. This structure is required for submission to the 
Collaborative Interlingual Index, but web services may of course return shorter
fragments of the structure.

    { 
      "@context": "http://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas/wn-json-context-1.0.json",
      "@graph": [{

The following are required properties of every WordNet (note the language
must be given twice). `@id` gives the identifier of this wordnet (should be
unique in this document) and `@type` must be `lime:Lexicon`.

          "@context": { "@language": "en" },
          "@id": "example-en",
          "@type": "lime:Lexicon", 
          "label": "Example wordnet (English)",
          "language": "en",
          "email": "john@mccr.ae",
          "rights": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",
          "version": "1.0",

In addition the properties `citation`, `url`, `status`, `confidenceScore` and any 
property from [Dublin Core Elements 1.1](http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/?v=elements)
May be used

          "citation": "CILI: the Collaborative Interlingual Index. Francis Bond, Piek Vossen, John P. McCrae and Christiane Fellbaum, Proceedings of the Global WordNet Conference 2016, (2016).",
          "url": "http://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas",
          "publisher": "Global Wordnet Association",

The entries are given as a list under the `entry` property it requires an `@id`
`partOfSpeech` and `lemma` and may have `sense`, `synBehavior`, `status`, 
`confidence` and Dublin Core properties. The lemma has only a single value 
`writtenForm` and the `partOfSpeech` must be one of the following:
[ `noun`, `verb`, `adjective`, `adverb`, `adjective_satellite`, `phrase`, `conjunction`, `adposition`, `other`, `unknown` ]. The `@id` must be unique in the
document, it is not the same as the `@id` of the wordnet or any other entry.

          "entry": [{
              "@id" : "w1",
              "lemma": { "writtenForm": "father" }, 
              "partOfSpeech": "noun",

The Sense requires only an `@id` and a `synsetRef` and may take `status`, 
`confidenceScore`, Dublin Core properties, an `example`.


              "sense": [{
                  "@id": "example-en-10161911-n-1",
                  "synsetRef": "example-en-10161911-n"
              }]
          }, {
              "@id" : "w2",
              "lemma": { "writtenForm": "paternal grandfather" }, 
              "partOfSpeech": "noun",
              "sense": [{
                  "@id": "example-en-1-n-1",
                  "synsetRef": "example-en-1-n",

A sense may also have any number of `relations` which have a `relType` from the
list below and a `target` and may have Dublin Core properties

* `antonym`: An opposite and inherently incompatible word
* `also`: See also, a reference of weak meaning
* `verb_group`: Verb senses that similar in meaning and have been manually grouped together.
* `participle`: An adjective that is a participle form a verb
* `pertainym`: A relational adjective. Adjectives that are pertainyms are usually defined by such phrases as "of or pertaining to" and do not have antonyms. A pertainym can point to a noun or another pertainym
* `derivation`: A word that is derived from some other word
* `domain_category`: Indicates the category of this word
* `domain_member_category`: Indicates a word involved in this category described by this word
* `domain_region`: Indicates the region of this word
* `domain_member_region`: Indicates a word involved in the region described by this word
* `exemplifies`: Indicates the usage of this word
* `is_exemplified_by`: Indicates a word involved in the usage described by this word

                  "relations": [{
                      "relType": "derivation",
                      "target": "example-en-10161911-n-1",
                      "creator": "John McCrae"
                  }]
              }]
          }, {
              "@id": "w3",
              "lemma": { "writtenForm": "pay" },
              "partOfSpeech": "verb",

The syntactic behavior is given here as follows:

              "synBehavior": [
                 {"label": "Sam cannot %s Sue"}, 
                 {"label": "Sam and Sue %s"},
                 {"label": "The banks %s the check"}
               ]
          }],
 
Synsets are listed under the `synset` property.
A synset requires only an `@id`. It may take an `ili` which is a code from the 
CILI (starting with `ili:i`), a `definition`, an `iliDefinition` (which must 
be given in English), `status`, `confidenceScore`, `relations` and Dublin Core properties.

In contrast to the XML form the `ili` is optional. If there is no match omit this
tag, if you wish to propose a new synset add only a `iliDefinition`.

          "synset": [{
              "@id": "example-en-10161911-n",
              "partOfSpeech": "noun",
              "ili": "ili:i90287",

Definitions must have a `gloss` and may be have a `language`, in addition, 
`status`, `confidenceScore` and Dublin Core properties may be added. An 
`iliDefinition` is the same but may not have a language.

              "definition": [{
                "gloss": "that which is perceived or known or inferred to have its own distinct existence (living or nonliving)"
               }],

Synset relations are given as for sense relations except the `target` must be the
`@id` of another synset not a sense. The following properties can be used:

* `hypernym`: A concept with a broader meaning
* `hyponym`: A concept with a narrower meaning
* `instance_hypernym`: The class of objects to which this instance belongs
* `instance_hyponym`: An individual instance of this class
* `part_holonym`: A larger whole that this concept is part of
* `part_meronym`: A part of this concept
* `member_holonym`: A group that this concept is a member of
* `member_meronym`: A member of this concept
* `substance_holonym`: Something where a constituent material is this concept
* `substance_meronym`: A constituent material of this concept
* `entail`: A verb X entails Y if X cannot be done unless Y is, or has been, done.
* `cause`: A verb that causes another
* `similar`: Similar, though not necessarily interchangeable
* `also`: See also, a reference of weak meaning
* `attribute`: A noun for which adjectives express values. The noun weight is an attribute, for which the adjectives light and heavy express values.
* `verb_group`: Verb senses that similar in meaning and have been manually grouped together.
* `domain_category`: Indicates the category of this word
* `domain_member_category`: Indicates a word involved in this category described by this word
* `domain_region`: Indicates the region of this word
* `domain_member_region`: Indicates a word involved in the region described by this word
* `exemplifies`: Indicates the usage of this word
* `is_exemplified_by`: Indicates a word involved in the usage described by this word

              "relations": [{
                  "relType": "hypernym", "target": "example-en-10162692-n"
              }],

Indicate the members and the order they occur in:

RDF
---

The RDF schema is significantly more flexible and builds principally on the 
[W3C OntoLex Model](http://cimiano.github.io/ontolex/specification.html). The 
details of the RDF serialization are principally built on those of the JSON-LD
model. We include a separate tutorial here for the benefit of those who wish
to create their resource natively in RDF.

The standard namespaces are

    @prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
    @prefix ili: <http://ili.globalwordnet.org/ili/> .
    @prefix lime: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/lime#> .
    @prefix ontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#> .
    @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
    @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
    @prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
    @prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .
    @prefix synsem: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/synsem#> .
    @prefix wn: <http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/ontology#> .
    @prefix wordnetlicense: <http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/license/> .

Each wordnet is an instance of the class `lime:Lexicon` and must have the
following properties

* `rdfs:label`: A name for the wordnet.
* `dc:language`: The BCP 47 identifier for your language (usually a two letter code)
* `schema:email`: An email address for the owner of the wordnet
* `dc:rights`: A link to the license of the resource
* `owl:versionInfo`: The version number of this resource

The mapping to the Lemon-OntoLex model is as follows:

* Words are `ontolex:LexicalEntry`, they must have a `ontolex:canonicalForm` 
  and a `wn:partOfSpeech`. 
* Senses are `ontolex:LexicalSense`, they must have a `ontolex:reference`
* Synsets are `ontolex:LexicalConept`.
* Definitions and examples are given by `skos:definition` and `skos:example` 
  optionally with a `rdf:value`.
